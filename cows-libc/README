"WASI" the WebAssembly System Interface.

WASI libc is conceptually the lower half of a traditional libc implementation.
It provides C interfaces to the low-level WASI syscalls.

This is largely based on [CloudABI], [cloudlibc], and [libpreopen], however we
use just the low-level syscall wrappers rather than all of cloudlibc and
libpreopen, and we have several customizations for use in a WebAssembly sysroot.

[CloudABI]: https://cloudabi.org
[cloudlibc]: https://github.com/NuxiNL/cloudlibc
[libpreopen]: https://github.com/musec/libpreopen

The upstream repositories and versions used here are:

cloudabi - https://github.com/NuxiNL/cloudabi af51ede669dbca0875d20893dae7f760b052b238
cloudlibc - https://github.com/NuxiNL/cloudlibc 742ea0899ab9ecc9746692d9035936032f4a52f4
libpreopen - https://github.com/musec/libpreopen 8265fc50b9db3730c250597bdd084f1e728f3e48

Whole files which are unused are omitted. Changes to upstream code are wrapped
in preprocessor directives controlled by the macro `__wasilibc_unmodified_upstream__`.

WASI libc currently depends on the basics and dlmalloc components of reference-sysroot.
